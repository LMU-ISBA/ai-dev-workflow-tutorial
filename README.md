# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Tutorial

Learn a professional development workflow by building and deploying a real project: an e-commerce sales dashboard.

```
PRD  →  spec-kit  →  Jira  →  Code  →  Commit  →  Push  →  Deploy  →  Live!
```

## How it works

You'll set up the same tools that development teams use, then build a dashboard from a product requirements document using AI-assisted development.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| GitHub | Hosts your code and tracks versions |
| Jira | Tracks tasks and requirements |
| Cursor | Code editor (VS Code-based, with AI features) |
| Claude Code | AI assistant that runs in your terminal |
| spec-kit | Turns requirements into a structured plan |
| Python + Streamlit | What you build the dashboard with |

## Getting started

### Version 2 (current)

Async pre-work + a 3-hour live workshop.

1. Start with [Pre-work: Setup](v2/pre-work-setup.md) — accounts, tools, repo setup (60-90 min on your own)
2. Then [Workshop: Build & Deploy](v2/workshop-build-deploy.md) — plan, build, and deploy the dashboard (~3 hours, live)
