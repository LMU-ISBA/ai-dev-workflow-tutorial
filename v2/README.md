# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Tutorial

Two versions of the AI-assisted development workflow tutorial, designed for capstone students.

Both versions teach the same complete workflow — from requirements to a deployed Streamlit dashboard — using the same tools (GitHub, Jira, Cursor, Claude Code, spec-kit). They differ in depth and format.

## Version A: The Streamlined Walkthrough

**Best for:** In-class use, students who prefer to follow along step-by-step

A focused, action-oriented guide. Every section is numbered steps with checkpoints. Minimal explanatory text — just enough context to understand what you're doing and why. Troubleshooting is embedded inline, not in a separate document.

| File | Content | Time |
|------|---------|------|
| [session-1-setup.md](version-a-walkthrough/session-1-setup.md) | Accounts, tools, repo setup | ~100 min |
| [session-2-workflow.md](version-a-walkthrough/session-2-workflow.md) | Spec-kit, Jira, build, deploy | ~100 min |

## Version B: The Comprehensive Guide

**Best for:** Self-paced learning, pre-reading before class, reference after class

A thorough guide that explains the "why" behind every step. Includes concept explanations, professional context, capstone connections, visual diagrams, and career-relevant pro tips. Ideal for students who want to understand the tools deeply, not just use them.

| File | Content | Time |
|------|---------|------|
| [session-1-setup.md](version-b-reference/session-1-setup.md) | Accounts, tools, repo setup + concepts | ~100 min |
| [session-2-workflow.md](version-b-reference/session-2-workflow.md) | Spec-kit, Jira, build, deploy + concepts | ~100 min |

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Version A | Version B |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Tone** | "Do this, verify that" | "Here's why, then do this" |
| **Length** | ~3,000-4,000 words/session | ~6,000-8,000 words/session |
| **Concepts** | 1-2 sentence definitions inline | Dedicated explanation blocks with diagrams |
| **Troubleshooting** | Compact table at end | Detailed: symptom, cause, fix |
| **Visual aids** | Minimal | ASCII diagrams, workflow visuals |
| **Best use** | Following along in real-time | Reading ahead or reviewing after |

## What Students Build

Both versions guide students through building and deploying an **E-Commerce Sales Dashboard** using Streamlit, with:

- 2 KPI scorecards (Total Sales, Total Orders)
- 1 line chart (sales trend over time)
- 2 bar charts (sales by category, sales by region)

The dashboard is the vehicle. The real learning is the **professional workflow**: PRD, spec-kit, Jira, Git, Claude Code, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- A computer (macOS or Windows)
- Willingness to create accounts and install tools
- No prior experience with Git, Jira, or AI coding tools required
