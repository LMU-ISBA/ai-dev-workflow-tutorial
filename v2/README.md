# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Tutorial

This tutorial teaches you a professional development workflow by having you build and deploy a real project: an e-commerce sales dashboard.

You'll work through it in two parts:

| Part | What you do | Time |
|------|-------------|------|
| [Pre-work](pre-work-setup.md) | Set up accounts, install tools, get your repo ready | 60–90 min on your own, before the workshop |
| [Workshop](workshop-build-deploy.md) | Plan with spec-kit, build with Claude Code, deploy live | ~3 hours, live on Zoom |

## What you'll build

A Streamlit dashboard with KPI scorecards, a sales trend chart, and breakdowns by category and region. You can see the finished version here: https://sales-dashboard-greg-lontok.streamlit.app/

The dashboard itself is straightforward. The point is the workflow you use to build it: writing a spec, tracking work in Jira, building with an AI assistant, committing with Git, and deploying so anyone can access it.

## What you need

- Basic Python knowledge (if you've used pandas or written a few scripts, you're fine)
- A computer running macOS or Windows
- No prior experience with Git, Jira, or AI coding tools

## Where to start

Open [pre-work-setup.md](pre-work-setup.md) and work through it before the workshop.
