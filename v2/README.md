# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Tutorial (Version 2)

Async pre-work + live workshop format. Students complete setup on their own during the week, then build and deploy together in a 3-hour session.

## Files

| File | Content | Time |
|------|---------|------|
| [pre-work-setup.md](pre-work-setup.md) | Accounts, tools, repo setup + concepts | 60–90 min (async, before workshop) |
| [workshop-build-deploy.md](workshop-build-deploy.md) | Spec-kit, Jira, build, deploy + concepts | ~3 hours (live workshop) |

## How to Use

- Complete the **pre-work** before the workshop — it walks you through accounts, tools, and repo setup
- Bring your completed setup to the **workshop**, where you will build and deploy the dashboard together
- "Why This Matters" callouts explain professional relevance of each step
- "Key Concept" callouts define important ideas with visual diagrams
- "Pro Tip" callouts offer career and capstone advice
- Troubleshooting sections explain root causes, not just fixes

## What Students Build

The pre-work and workshop guide students through building and deploying an **E-Commerce Sales Dashboard** using Streamlit, with:

- 2 KPI scorecards (Total Sales, Total Orders)
- 1 line chart (sales trend over time)
- 2 bar charts (sales by category, sales by region)

The dashboard is the vehicle. The real learning is the **professional workflow**: PRD, spec-kit, Jira, Git, Claude Code, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- A computer (macOS or Windows)
- Willingness to create accounts and install tools
- No prior experience with Git, Jira, or AI coding tools required
