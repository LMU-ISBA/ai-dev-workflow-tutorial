# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Tutorial (Version 2)

A comprehensive guide to the AI-assisted development workflow, designed for two 100-minute sessions.

## Files

| File | Content | Time |
|------|---------|------|
| [session-1-setup.md](session-1-setup.md) | Accounts, tools, repo setup + concepts | ~100 min |
| [session-2-workflow.md](session-2-workflow.md) | Spec-kit, Jira, build, deploy + concepts | ~100 min |

## How to Use

- Read through before class for maximum preparation, or follow along during class
- "Why This Matters" callouts explain professional relevance of each step
- "Key Concept" callouts define important ideas with visual diagrams
- "Pro Tip" callouts offer career and capstone advice
- Troubleshooting sections explain root causes, not just fixes

## What Students Build

Both sessions guide students through building and deploying an **E-Commerce Sales Dashboard** using Streamlit, with:

- 2 KPI scorecards (Total Sales, Total Orders)
- 1 line chart (sales trend over time)
- 2 bar charts (sales by category, sales by region)

The dashboard is the vehicle. The real learning is the **professional workflow**: PRD, spec-kit, Jira, Git, Claude Code, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- A computer (macOS or Windows)
- Willingness to create accounts and install tools
- No prior experience with Git, Jira, or AI coding tools required
